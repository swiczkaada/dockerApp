# PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION (uncomment and set when deploying to production)
# DOMAIN_PROD=example.com
# PROTOCOL_PROD=https

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATION
# If you don't have a domain name and want to expose your local server publicly, you can use ngrok
# For local usage, you can set your local IP and port here:

# PORT=8000
# DOMAIN_IP=192.168.x.x    # Replace with your local machine IP address
# PROTOCOL=http

# Alternatively, use ngrok to expose your local server securely:
# 1. Run your Django server locally on port 8000
# 2. Start ngrok with: ngrok http 8000
# 3. ngrok will give you a public URL (https://xxxxx.ngrok.io) which you can use as your DOMAIN with PROTOCOL=https

# Example for ngrok usage:
# DOMAIN_NGROK=3d07-xxxx.ngrok-free.app
# PROTOCOL_PROD=https
